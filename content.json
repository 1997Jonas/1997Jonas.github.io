Its main features include: Collect and store the documents. (Title, arthor, year, journal, reference type, etc.) Find and manage the documents. (Search, rating, group, etc.) Help the researchers use the correct format for the papers. (Paper templates for different journals, working together with Word, etc.) We can regard what EndNote does as building a personal library, where the books, journals, videos, legal papers, pictures and others are stored. Besides EndNote Destop, EndNote Web is also availbale.

They need to work togeter. Importing Documents Manual input(Not recommanded):Reference -&gt; New Reference or click the ‘New Reference’ button or use the keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+N). When you input the author, the system will regrad the last word as the family name automatically. And if the arthor’s given name contains more than one word, the first name and the last name should be seperated by ‘,’. Remember to attach the files (.pdf, .jpg, .mov, etc.), if not, it’s just a bunch of information. Use ‘the find full text’ function can make it easy to get done. Steps:Choose the document you want to find the full text, and then click the Reference-&gt; Find full text. Make sure you have right network connect, which means you can get access to the databases. Importing file…/Folder…:File-&gt;Import-&gt;File…/Folder…. When you are importing a file, remember to change the import option to DPF. Besides, you can import a library here just by change the import option to EndNote Library.

Choose the papers need downloading. Choose save to EndNote Destop (Or EndNote Online if you like). Choose the content to be saved and click send button. Open the .ciw file that is just downloaded by EndNote Destop. Find full text for the papers or attach them manually. Likely, this approach can be used in Google Scholar, 万方数据库, etc. More details about how to import documents from diffrent databases or connect other libraries can be seen in EndNote &amp; Word文献管理与论文写作 第2版_童国伦主编2014.pdf.
