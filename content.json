Here lists some guidance: Classic reviews: This kind of articles are rather useful for getting started in a brand-new field. We can learn a lot of basic method and opinions in this field. Classic pit-digging articles: Here, the pits mean somewhere plenty of researers will go. In other words, this kind of articles lead new directions in this field. Classic method articles: This kinds of articles can be cited in the reviews, but sometimes the content in the reviews is too concise to understand deeply. So, we need to go back to the original articles, which are often with more details. Here, methods includes problem formulation, theory, algorithm, experimental design, etc. Classic textbooks: Some totally basic knowledge is regarded as the common knowledge that everyone knows. So, if we need to learn something basic, we’d better go back to the classic textbooks. Others: Some prerequisites, complements, comparisons of this field or the major methods of this field. After we decide our research quetion, though all the papers can provide us with some useful information, we need to read those that are most related to our research question. In other words, we need to judge if a paper is worthy for our research. Relativity: We can judge from the title, key words, abstract, conclusion, charts, etc. We need to do this fast. Quality: We can judge from the author or the lab, or the citation the paper gets. After we choose the papers we want to read, we need to know how to read it effectively. In a paper, it’s four factors that matters, including What, Why, How, and the second What. What: What’s the author’s research quetion? Why: Why would the author do the research? What’s importance? What’s the implication? What’s the relevance of this research with the others? How: How did the author try to solve the problem? What’s the problem formulation? What’s the research method? How did the author get the data? What’s experiments? etc. What: What’s the conclusion of this research? What’s the perspective and outlook of this research? Sometimes, a good paper just presents a good story. How to write a paper Idea searching. For a long time: Record every inspiration we get from the daily life or some documents. And we should remember: more reading, thinking and discussing, more improvement our ideas will get. Finally, sometimes when gathering the dots, we may get some brand-new ideas and do a rather great job. For a short time: Try to improve the existing methods. Apply the methods you know to some new field. etc. But make sure that your idea has not been published. Document research.Go back to the text above to see which papers are worth reading and how to choose and analyse a paper. Preliminary validation.Proof of concept. Exploring in depth.Do the experiments and collect the data. After that analyse them. Paper writing. Title: Concisely summarize the content in the paper, and draw the attention of the readers. Some typical styles are listed as follows: Question. Question + Solution. Story Telling. Key Words: They should be precise, attractive, convenient for indexing. Field, question, method, new terminologies can be included. The number of key words should be around 5. Abstract: Principle: PARI. Problem. Approach. Result. Impact.The abstract should be a story with good logic. Introduction: Introduce the background, importance of the paper and the method, conclusion of the paper.Specifically: Background: it presents the readers the researching knowledge. Question and its importance. Simple introduction of the research method and the conclusion. The importance of the conclusion. (Optional) The perspective. Literature review: relation to the existing literature, rationale for case/data/method selection. Problem formulation: Set up the model. Make the practical problems abstract and the abstract problems concrete. Method: Introduce the research method with details, including the reasonability of the method (algorithm), the collection of the data, the experiments, etc. Result: Integrated process of argumentation. (Hypothesis, arguments, logic, analysis, etc.) Discussions: The meaning of the result. Discussion the problem under a bigger background, like the complements to the theory and the methodology, the contribution to the industry. Summary/Conclusion/Perspectives: Summarize the paper and give the outlook. Reference/Bibliography: Different styles for different journals. Google scholar and EndNote can generate the citation automatically. Appendix/Supplemental Materials/Notation Table (Optional) Summary, reflection and prospect. Some techniques for paper writing: First do the addition, and then do the subtraction. First decide what kinds of figures we may use in the paper and their order, and then we can write our paper following the figure series.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Basic Skills/基本技能","slug":"Basic-Skills-基本技能","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/Basic-Skills-基本技能/"}],"keywords":[]},{"title":"Some Useful Techniques in Word For Paper Writing/一些便于论文写作的Word技巧","slug":"Some-Useful-Techniques-in-Word-For-Paper-Writing","date":"2019-03-11T15:36:26.000Z","updated":"2019-03-12T13:21:18.663Z","comments":true,"path":"2019/03/11/Some-Useful-Techniques-in-Word-For-Paper-Writing/","link":"","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/2019/03/11/Some-Useful-Techniques-in-Word-For-Paper-Writing/","excerpt":"","text":"Tables can be a very useful tool.

Its main features include: Collect and store the documents. (Title, author, year, journal, reference type, etc.) Find and manage the documents. (Search, rating, group, etc.) Help the researchers use the correct format for the papers. (Paper templates for different journals, working together with Word, etc.) We can regard what EndNote does as building a personal library, where the books, journals, videos, legal papers, pictures and others are stored. Besides EndNote Desktop, EndNote Web is also available. Building or opening a libraryFile-&gt; New… or File-&gt; Open Library… or Open recent Tip: If you want share or move your library by copying the files, you need to copy both the .data file and the .enl file. They need to work together. Importing Documents Manual input(Not recommended):Reference -&gt; New Reference or click the ‘New Reference’ button or use the keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+N). When you input the author, the system will regard the last word as the family name automatically. And if the author’s given name contains more than one word, the first name and the last name should be separated by ‘,’. Remember to attach the files (.pdf, .jpg, .mov, etc.), if not, it’s just a bunch of information. Use ‘the find full text’ function can make it easy to get done. Steps:Choose the document you want to find the full text, and then click the Reference-&gt; Find full text. Make sure you have right network connect, which means you can get access to the databases. Importing file…/Folder…:File-&gt;Import-&gt;File…/Folder…. When you are importing a file, remember to change the import option to DPF. Besides, you can import a library here just by change the import option to EndNote Library. When you are importing a folder, you can choose if the result includes the subfolders and create a group set for this import. Importing online:Take Web of Science as an example. Choose the papers need downloading. Choose save to EndNote Desktop (Or EndNote Online if you like). Choose the content to be saved and click send button. Open the .ciw file that is just downloaded by EndNote Desktop. Find full text for the papers or attach them manually. Likely, this approach can be used in Google Scholar, 万方数据库, etc. More details about how to import documents from different databases or connect other libraries can be seen in EndNote &amp; Word文献管理与论文写作 第2版_童国伦主编2014.pdf. Managing the Libraries Group: Set up groups: To classify the documents. Right-click the ‘My Groups’ in the left of the UI. Groups-&gt;Create Group Smart Group:Assemble the documents that contain the same key words. Create groups from groups.Create From Groups: Intersection, complement, etc. Create groups set.The directory above the groups level. Search the documents. Quick search. Search Panel. Click the button to use. Find the Duplicates. References-&gt;Find Duplicates The setting of this function can be changed in Edit-&gt;Preference-&gt;Duplicates Revise the documents’ data (Title, abstract, etc.)Edit-&gt;Find and Replace Back-up for the libraries.

Cite While You Write (CWYW).To use this function, you need to open both EndNote and Word. Direct Way: Drag the papers you want to cite in EndNote to Word. Click the ‘Update Citations and Bibliography’ in EndNote X9 (or other versions) in Word. Searching Way: Click the ‘Insert Citations’ in the Toolbar in EndNote X9 in Word. Input the key words in the blank, and then find the references. Choose the one/ones you want to refer.The Style can be changed by the style options in the toolbar. Insert Figure. First, import the figures into EndNote. Click the ‘Insert Citations’ in the Toolbar in EndNote X9 in Word, choose to insert figure… Place the references in different chapters. Use the section breaks.
